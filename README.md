# North American Avian Biodiversity Analysis
This project aims to analyze and visualize avian biodiversity data in North America using R. The project will focus on integrating, analyzing, and visualizing data from FeederWatch.

The analysis will include species richness, distribution, abundance, and trends over time. The results will be presented through interactive data visualizations and maps, which will provide insights into the current state of avian populations in North America and help inform conservation efforts.
